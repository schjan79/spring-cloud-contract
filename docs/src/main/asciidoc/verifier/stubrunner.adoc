=== Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner

One of the issues that you could have encountered while using Spring Cloud Contract Verifier was to pass the generated WireMock JSON stubs from the server side to the client side (or various clients).
 The same takes place in terms of client side generation for messaging.

Copying the JSON files / setting the client side for messaging manually is out of the question.

That's why we'll introduce Spring Cloud Contract Stub Runner that can download and run the stubs
automatically for you.

==== Snapshot versions

Add the additional snapshot repository to your build.gradle to use snapshot versions which are automatically uploaded after every successful build:

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/pom.xml[tags=repos,indent=0]
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
include::{standalone_samples_path}/http-server/build.gradle[tags=repos,indent=0]
----

==== Publishing stubs as JARs

The easiest approach would be to centralize the way stubs are kept. For example you can keep them as JARs in a Maven repository.

TIP: For both Maven and Gradle the setup comes out of the box. But you can customize it if you want to.

[source,xml,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<!-- First disable the default jar setup in the properties section-->
include::{samples_url}/producer_with_restdocs/pom.xml[tags=skip_jar,indent=0]

<!-- Next add the assembly plugin to your build -->
include::{samples_url}/producer_with_restdocs/pom.xml[tags=assembly,indent=0]

<!-- Finally setup your assembly. Below you can find the contents of src/main/assembly/stub.xml -->
include::{samples_url}/producer_with_restdocs/src/assembly/stub.xml[indent=0]
----

[source,groovy,indent=0,subs="verbatim,attributes",role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
include::{plugins_path}/spring-cloud-contract-gradle-plugin/src/test/resources/functionalTest/scenarioProject/build.gradle[tags=jar_setup,indent=0]
----

==== Modules

==== Common properties for JUnit and Spring

Some of the properties that are repetitive can be set using system properties or configuration properties (for Spring). Here are their names with their default values:

[frame="topbot",options="header"]
|======================
| Property name | Default value | Description
|stubrunner.minPort|10000| Minimal value of a port for a started WireMock with stubs
|stubrunner.maxPort|15000| Minimal value of a port for a started WireMock with stubs
|stubrunner.repositoryRoot|| Maven repo url. If blank then will call the local maven repo
|stubrunner.classifier|stubs| Default classifier for the stub artifacts
|stubrunner.workOffline|false| If true then will not contact any remote repositories to download stubs
|stubrunner.ids|| Array of Ivy notation stubs to download
|stubrunner.username|| Optional username to access the tool that stores the JARs with stubs
|stubrunner.password|| Optional password to access the tool that stores the JARs with stubs
|======================

===== Stub runner stubs ids

You can provide the stubs to download via the `stubrunner.ids` system property. They follow the following pattern:

[source,java,indent=0]
----
groupId:artifactId:version:classifier:port
----

`version`, `classifier` and `port` are optional.

* If you don't provide the `port` then a random one will be picked
* If you don't provide the `classifier` then the default one will be taken. (NOTE that you can pass an empty classifier like this `groupId:artifactId:version:`)
* If you don't provide the `version` then the `+` will be passed and the latest one will be downloaded

Where `port` means the port of the WireMock server.
